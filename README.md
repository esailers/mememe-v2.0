# mememe-v2.0
MemeMe is a universal iOS app that I created in Swift for a project in the Udacity nanodegree program. This is the second version of the app.

## Specifications
MemeMe allows a user to create a meme, then to share it socially. The user picks an image from the camera or photo album, and inputs text at the top and bottom of the image. Here are some features included in the app:
- Shared data model
- Tab bar controller
- Table View
- Collection View
- Passing data via segues 
- Custom delegate implemented
